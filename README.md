# Model-OpenGL
School project to learn Modern OpenGL

# Description
Develop a basic 3D rendering engine in OpenGL 3 or higher.

# Implemented
Homemade LogFile and assert.
Wavefront obj parsing/reading (only triangle not quad!) using fscanf so this is SUPER fast.
Rendering multiple meshes.
Free view camera (forward (w), backward (s), left (a), right (d), up (space), down (l-ctrl), even sprinting (hold down l-shift)).
Manipulating meshes in scene.

# Missing
Lights
Textures
Scene Graph
IDK WHY I CAN'T START THE PROJECT IN RELEASE MOD!!!!
